### Express based Node Backend

Here we are using a JSON file full of beer(:beers:) information to act as a substitute database however the models can easily be changed to accommodate for an actual database.

EJS is being used as the templating language for its server side capabilities and because I like it, however that can also be changed to suit the users preference.
