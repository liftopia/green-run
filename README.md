### Express based Node Backend

Here we are using a JSON file full of beer(:beers:) information to act as a substitute database.

EJS is being used as the templating language for its server side capabilities and because I like it, however that can also be changed to suit the users preference.

### To Get Started
1. Fork repo
2. Pull to local machine
3. Download dependencies
4. Start server (npm start or npm run dev_start)

It's **THAT** easy

- [ ] delete beer object
